But they&amp;rsquo;re just a tiny dot!
They have a loud voice
But that ain&amp;rsquo;t worth squat.
They may seem big and scary
But they&amp;rsquo;re just a tiny dot!
They have a loud voice
But that ain&amp;rsquo;t worth squat.
Verse 1 - Illuminati Yes, my friend, it&amp;rsquo;s true, that they&amp;rsquo;re in on a plot:
They take your wealth and freedom while you&amp;rsquo;re home smokin&amp;rsquo; pot.</description></item><item><title>This Land Is Your Land (Agenda 21 Edition)</title><link>https://www.thewatersabove.org/songs/this-land-is-your-land/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 15:59:07 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.thewatersabove.org/songs/this-land-is-your-land/</guid><description>Verse 1 - Establish This land is your land, this land is my land.
Red state or blue state,
We aren&amp;rsquo;t peasants, but free p-e-o-ple.
This land was made for you and me.
Verse 2 - Agenda 21 UN Agenda for the 21st Century:
Eco-friendly? Or total tyranny?
Depopulation, reset ec-on-o-my.

for monitoring your comments online
If you step out of line then you will surely be fined.
Want a date? Speak well of the state!
Grumbles and groans? No more taxis or loans.
Seems like they need a way to transact
out of the government&amp;rsquo;s eye.
Chorus Monero: keeping credits and debits from the sight of the tax man!
Monero: decentralized, keeps running whether or not it&amp;rsquo;s been banned.</description></item><item><title>False Flag</title><link>https://www.thewatersabove.org/songs/false-flag/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 16:08:19 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.thewatersabove.org/songs/false-flag/</guid><description>Verse 1 Lusitania torpedoed,
hundreds drowned. But
Germany had warned dearly, the
ship, a military target, clearly.
1982, divers found the truth:
Britain had deceived its own.
Millions dead. Two years
from the founding of the Fed.
Chorus False Flag We spill blood and point the blame False Flag Psychopaths have no shame False Flag Can you believe
False Flag Millions are deceived

It&amp;rsquo;s all lies Don&amp;rsquo;t watch the news (man)
Taking over your mind Don&amp;rsquo;t watch the news (man)
It&amp;rsquo;s fake, you heard? Don&amp;rsquo;t watch the news (man)
Operation Mockingbird Verse 1 - Mockingbird  I was wearing my mask when a friend sent me A funny YouTube link in which I could see Dozens
of news stations speaking in synchrony, as
If controlled by some Invisible Hand.</description></item><item><title>The Center of Berlin</title><link>https://www.thewatersabove.org/songs/the-center-of-berlin/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 16:08:26 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.thewatersabove.org/songs/the-center-of-berlin/</guid><description>Come tell me Saleh-zaki, oh why are you so proud?
For I hear the Day of Freedom, oh it hardly drew a crowd.
Seventeen-thousand Neo-nazis, and fuming crazies? No!
A million happy Germans at the center of Berlin
The center of Berlin, oh the center of Berlin.
Germans traveled from all over to the center of Berlin.
And tell me, my dear Dunja, just how this came to be?
Me, I trust the media, and they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t lie to me.</description></item></channel></rss>
