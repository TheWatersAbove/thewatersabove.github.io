[Rage Against the State](http://rageagainstthestate.com/) is a freedom-themed festival in Bozeman, MT organized by Roger Roots, nationally recognized attorney and prominent Montana libertarian.

The event will include literature, music, comedy, and lectures. If you lean towards libertarianism, anarcho-capitalism, or your friends call you a "conspiracy theorist," you will be right at home.

Exact location is currently being determined. This page will soon be updated with the final venue.

We'll be playing in the afternoon/evening.

We hope to see you there!
