We each have become concerned about freedom through our own life experience.

Orwell warned us that there is a place from which the people cannot escape the grasp of the tyrant. That the way to escape is to "prevent it from happening in the first place."

Our world is slipping closer and closer to Orwell's nightmarish scenario, but we will not allow the world to fall under darkness.

Will you join us in the fight?
