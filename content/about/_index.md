Orwell warned us that there is a place from which the people cannot escape the grasp of the tyrant. That the only means of escaping tyranny is to "prevent it from happening in the first place."

Our world is slipping ever closer to Orwell's nightmarish scenario, but we will not allow the world to fall under darkness. 

Before deciding to start The Waters Above, I first joined prepper groups and spoke with proponents of the Second Amendment, but was disappointed to find that, though well-prepared to win the battle on the physical plane, all was not well on the mental and spiritual front.

So, rather than lifting up a gun, we will prevail by lifting up one another. 

Debate is one avenue, but it seems that many of us carry psychic wounds that cloud our ability to see and process new information.

Love is one avenue, but love is a message that can be carried across different mediums, rather than a medium itself.

Religion is one avenue, but religion, as practiced in the world, all too often sits between an individual and an authentic, direct relationship with the divine. 

Thus, the medium that we have chosen is music. In the words of Yip Harburg, "Words make you think. Music makes you feel. A song makes you feel a thought."

Our aim is take advantage of this, bottling higher vibrations into music. 

As you set off on your journey, all I ask is for you to set aside your preconceptions about government, history, and even "science" as you know it.

Enjoy the ride.
