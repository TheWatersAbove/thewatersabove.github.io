Come tell me Saleh-zaki, oh why are you so proud?  
For I   hear the Day of Freedom, oh it hardly drew a crowd.  
Seventeen-thousand Neo-nazis, and fuming crazies? No!  
A  million happy Germans at the center of Berlin  

The center of Berlin, oh the center of Berlin.   
Germans traveled from all over to the center of Berlin.  
And  tell me, my dear Dunja, just how this came to be?  
Me, I trust the media, and they wouldn't lie to me.  

I was there, she told me, it was such a peaceful scene.  
There were  mothers nursing babies, strangers' picnics in be-tween.  
Germans joined together in their cause as if were kin.  
A taste of Eden at the very center of Ber-lin.  

The center of Berlin, oh the center of Berlin.   
A million Germans sitting at the center of Ber-lin.  
"It's the end of the Plandemic," cried the people in Berlin,  
"With these draconic measures, yes, our patience has worn thin."  

Left and right I looked and saw not a sign of hate. A   
stage was at the middle, wonder sped up my heart rate. Po-lice   
at the microphone were saying they could see: Thousands   
numb'ring first five-hundred, then nine-hundred, one-point-three!  

The center of Berlin, oh the center of Berlin,  
A mill-ion Germans rallied at the center of Ber-lin.  
Police were getting nervous as the crowd began to grow.  
They got  orders from above and canceled the whole show.  

Ger-mans, very docile, traveled home without a din.  
You-and-I--, however, are a far cry from Ger-man.   
Politicians serve the people, in case you haven't heard:  
Do your job, we tell you, else be thrown out on the curb!  

The center of Berlin, oh the center of Berlin.   
A million Germans marching through the center of Ber-lin.   
All along the Paulstraube, throngs of protestors are seen: smiling   
faces flying banners saying "no" to the vac-cine.    

For them to govern us we must first consent, you see.  
Distasteful things that happen are all-owed by you and me.  
If the ruler's out of favor, she will promptly tailspin.  
Threatened  by the million Germans at the center of Ber-lin.  

The center of Berlin, oh the center of Berlin.  
A million Germans gathered at the center of Ber-lin.  
When the  news says you're outnumbered, you can wear wear a knowing grin:  
One mil, three hundred thousand, first of August in Berlin.
