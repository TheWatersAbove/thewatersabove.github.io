## Verse 1 - China

In China they have a system   
for monitoring your comments online  
If you step out of line then you will surely be fined.  

Want a date? Speak well of the state!  
Grumbles and groans? No more taxis or loans.  
Seems like they need a way to transact  
out of the government's eye.  

## Chorus

Monero: keeping credits and debits from the sight of the tax man!  
Monero: decentralized, keeps running whether or not it's been banned.  
Let's prevent a war --   
Transact outside of the  
social credit score!  

## Verse 2 - Fedcoin

Janet Yellen wants to tax   
unrealized gains and everything else.  
So she's working on cryptocurrency we call Fedcoin.  

All our accounts will be at the Fed.  
Taxed directly, sanctions imposed.  
Follow along, and you'll be living in a communist hell!  

## Bridge

Monero: private money!  
Monero: fungibility!  
Monero: anonymity!  
Commerce set free:  
Freedom for you and me!  

## Verse 3

McAfee told us: Bitcoin won't help.   
Chain analysis indicts yourself.  
Criminal? Or is it that federal taxes are theft?  

Darkweb markets use Monero, too:  
Scoop up a fake vaccine card or two!  
Hide your assets, escape from Canada while you still can!
