## Chorus

Don't watch the news, man!  
It's all lies   
Don't watch the news (man)  
Taking over your mind   
Don't watch the news (man)  
It's fake, you heard?   
Don't watch the news (man)  
Operation Mockingbird   

## Verse 1 - Mockingbird 

I was wearing my mask when a friend sent me   
A funny YouTube link in which I could see Dozens  
of news stations speaking in synchrony, as   
If controlled by some Invisible Hand.  
I couldn't understand how our separate, local news Could  
reach word-for-word identical views! This  
was the moment where I scratched my chin, asking,  
"Is it North Korea that we're living in?"   

## Verse 2 - Fauci's Contradictions

In Fauci, we trust, that's what they say, Even  
though his guidance changes like every damn day.   

<em>Fauci</em>:  
Masks? Don't wear one. Please wear one. Wait now don't.  
Two weeks. Four weeks. (Two years later...)  
Natural. Man-made. (Which one is it?)  
Vaccines aren't for children. But now they are.  Just   
until there's a vax... I meant IN everyone!  
FDA-approved! We skipped the trials, though.   

## Verse 3 - COVID Fakery

"How to Lie with Statistics," one of Bill's favorite books.  
Ironically, our heroes, mostly are crooks.  
Sky News: "the chimneys, they never stop burning" Jeff   
Berwick, same morgue, and nothing turning!  
Dancing nurses, empty hospitals. COVID is scary!  
PCR don't mean much. Just ask Kary.  
Headache? COVID. Cough? COVID. Flu? COVID. Pneumonia? COVID.  
Crashed Motorcycle? Definitely COVID!  

## Verse 4 - Communist Censorship

My father told me: "America's the best.   
unlike Russia or China, We have a free press!"   
For Chinese online, many words are verboten  
Question the party and you'll soon be croakin'  
With Russian minds, Putin likes messing. Puts   
out conflicting stories to keep his people guessing!  
Russians like to joke that our governments are twins -- Only   
difference: Russians know what a pickle they're in!  
 
## Verse 5 - Fox News

I've been watching CNN, is Fox any better? C.I.-  
A. got them both sad news! But Here's   
the solution: don't give them views.    
Google and YouTube? Book-burners, both.  
I like TikTok. Chinese? Good luck!  
Facebook, Instagram?  Do you trust Zuck?  Tele-  
gram's good! Might be a honeypot.  
Decentralize -- the answer for free thought.
