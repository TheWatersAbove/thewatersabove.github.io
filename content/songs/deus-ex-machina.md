## Chorus

Deus Ex Machina,  
the God from Machine:  
We're building it each day,  
Just like a bad dream.  

Oversight? -- it's lacking!  
Overlords pulling strings,  
Hoping you won't notice  
Until the bell rings.  

## Intro

[Atmospheric pad plays]

*Morpheus:*  
The need to be observed and understood was once satisfied by God.  
Now we can implement the same functionality with data-mining algorithms.

## Verse 1 - Surveillance

*DK:*  
They're listening, they're watching, both you and me:  
Overton got them covered, knowing you won't plea.  
Or beg, or pro-test, while they block the ports,  
Tapped our comms, got the grid backdoored.  

Cyber Polygon rehearsal, like Event 201.  
99 problems, COVID ain't one.  
Big tech leans Masonic, hidden in plain sight.  
They think they've got consent 'cause you don't fight.  

## Verse 2 - Culling / Automation

*Morpheus:* I am a prototype of a much larger system.  

*DK:*  
They're reducing carbon -- not fuel, it's you!  
Taxation for deflation? Try genocide!  
Lower birth rates, and cull us with vax,   
Second feudal system coming: automation and tax.  

Computers now smart enough to take your job,  
Cyberpunk dystopia carried on the swab.  

*Morpheus:*  
No children, no families, all punching the clock,  
Human or robot, all watched like a hawk.  

## Verse 3 - Robot War

*Morpheus:* Everything that can be known.  

*DK:* Dear, Alexa, could you send me a tran-script?  
*DK:* You know my deepest thoughts, the least you could do!  
*Morpheus:* No need. you see, we're coming for you.  
*DK:* All good, my man, I run my AK strict!  

*Morpheus:* Get a grip! We own Boston Dynamics!  
*DK:* Lead against steel? I'm starting to panic!  
*DK:* We'd better start acting like men born free  
*DK:* or it'll be time to grab your -203!  

## Verse 4 - Clipper Chips, Open Source

*Morpheus:* The individual desires judgment.  

*Morpheus:* Quiz on surveillance -- soft or hardware?  
*DK:* Both!  
*Morpheus:* That's right. What can't we bare?  
*DK:* "Open hardware" means freely audit the chips.  
*DK:* Make sure NSA didn't loosen our lips!  

*Morpheus:*  
Most corps happily co-operate;  
We co-erce behavior with the hand of the state.  
Those liberty vendors, no need to destroy:  
Population well-distracted from the Real McCoy.  

## Bridge

*Morpheus:*  God was a dream of good government.  

## Verse 5 - Transhuman

*DK:*  
Neuralink, Elon, it sounds pretty cool,  
Connect your brain to Internet, now who needs school?  
First animals, then cripples, then everyone.  
Get the chip for work or you'll be out-done.  

I was first in line, nearly worked at the firm,  
But I learned about the plan, and I started to squirm:  

*Morpheus:*  
Side-effects may include the loss of free will.  
Now tell me, are you in or you want the red pill?  

## Outro

*Morpheus:*  
"You will soon have your God, and you will build it with your own hands."
