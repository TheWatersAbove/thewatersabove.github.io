## Intro

They may seem big and scary  
But they're just a tiny dot!  
They have a loud voice  
But that ain't worth squat.  

They may seem big and scary  
But they're just a tiny dot!  
They have a loud voice  
But that ain't worth squat.  

## Chorus A - Illuminati

Yes, my friend, it's true, that they're in on a plot:  
They take your wealth and freedom while you're home smokin' pot.  
They ca-n't change oil, but can da-nce the fox-trot.  
Sleepin' with a mistress, but call it Camelot.  

"Useless eaters", we're called, lower than snot;  
Systematic culling -- can you re-ad the ink blot?  
From what-they've-done-so-far, it's in-a-cell-they'll-rot.  
If things-go-any-further, then they're gonna get shot!  

## Verse 2 - Trauma

From an early age, you've-been-hit-by-the rod,  
Told not Christ or Krish-na, but gov-ernment's your God.  
Criminals -- don't be one; be a good little boy.  
Kneel down and follow, it's the role of a goy  

Proclaimed since the sixties, on national TV,  
"TRUST, CONSUME, OBEY," sub-liminally.  
It-all-begins-at-birth with a slap on the bum.  
Taught-ever-to-fe-ar them, from-here-to-kingdom-come.  

## Chorus B - Trauma

You-think-you-paid-your-taxes, _ they want all you got!  
"Follow the rules or we'll take-your-mug-shot!"  
They know if you're pregnant by watching what you bought.  
Treated just like cattle -- we are on a feed lot.  

Traumatizing _you_ ever-since-you've-been-a-tot:  
"Don't you rock the boat, just sit down-into-your-slot."  
"No creative thinking, we want a ro-bot."  
Biggest threat to them, my friend, is free thought.  

## Verse 3 - Military Mirage

"Military-might-a-myth," heard in the service.  
Please don't tell the joint chiefs, they're gonna get nervous!  
Eight ta-nks operational? More like 3. (What?)  
I hear it works a little bit like this, you see:  

When the general comes inspecting, _ you gotta look good:  
Who cares that there's nothin' under the hood?  
Bor-row parts, move 'em, and do what you can,  
Gotta just-ify that funding from Un-cle Sam!  

## Verse 4 - Police

Think hard now: apart from TV,  
have you seen po-lice acting heroically?  
Can't recall? The truth, mon ami:  
Po-lice aren't here to aid yo-u or me.  

Rather than serving in a noble band,  
They are fingers on _an_ In-visible Hand.  
They would rather be the boot that stomps the face,  
and, on a good day, faulty evidence place.  

## Chorus D - Law Enforcement

If shit hits the fan, war in counties will be fought.  
Obama armed the cops, _ yes, your lo-cal SWAT.  
Their armories are full, _ paid and bought,  
By-your-money: .223, hollowpoints -- jack-pot!  

If surrounded or outnumbered, you may be caught.  
But cops-aren't-good-at-range; that's not-what-they're-taught.  
Practice mindful-ly and you'll make the sh-ot.  
Scratch one thrall -- of the tiny dot!  

## Chorus E - Agenda 21

"Reduce your carbon footprint" while they're using megawa-tts,  
They think that the Earth is theirs to allot.  
Their plan, FYI, _ is not a pretty thought --  
Control and genocide, taking everything we got.  

Sitting by and watching means: in-net-we'll-be-caught.  
Time is getting short, future windows will be naught.   
Heed and listen up be-cause this is our shot:  
To throw the shackles off and discard The Tiny Dot.  

## Chorus C - Military / Spooks

Though I speak of vi-o-lence, that path is fraught, with  
Heart-break and mis-ery -- put down the garotte!  
So if-a-bloodless-coup is be-ing sought,   
All-we-have-to-do is tax boycott.  

By-defunding-Uncle-Sam, taxation-is-theft,  
The controllers will quickly _be_ bereft.  
Out with the Dollar, and Fedcoin is null.  
Move to private crypto, before the cull!  
 
## Verse 5 - Defund the Government

I-used-to-think-the-prez-was-boss; he's just a mas-cot. Real   
pow-er is Masonic, 33rd Degree Scot.  They are   
reading Robb Report, dreaming of a bigger yacht,  
And in a royal bloodline were begot.  

"Silent-Weapons-Quiet-Wars" -- guide to the onslaught.  
A glimpse inside the mind of a ruling stinkpot.  
Plans like this are couriered on a micro-dot.   
By _ will-ing psychos like Revolver Ocelot.  

## Coda

They may see-m big and scary  
But they're just a tiny dot!  
They have a loud voice  
But that ain't worth squat.  

They may see-m big and scary  
But they're just a tiny dot!  
They have a loud voice  
But that ain't worth squat.
