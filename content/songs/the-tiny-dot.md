## Intro

They may seem big and scary  
But they're just a tiny dot!  
They have a loud voice  
But that ain't worth squat.  

They may seem big and scary  
But they're just a tiny dot!  
They have a loud voice  
But that ain't worth squat.  

## Verse 1 - Illuminati

Yes, my friend, it's true, that they're in on a plot:  
They take your wealth and freedom while you're home smokin' pot.  
They can't change oil, but can dance the foxtrot.  
Sleepin' with a mistress, but call it Camelot.  

"Useless eaters", we're called, lower than snot;  
Systematic culling -- can you read the ink blot?  
From what they've done so far, it's in a cell they'll rot.  
If things go any further, then they're gonna get shot!  
  
## Verse 2 - Brainwashing

From an early age, you've been hit by the rod,  
Told not Christ or Krishna, but government's your God.  
Criminals -- don't be one; be a good little boy.  
Kneel down and follow, it's the role of a goy  

Proclaimed since the sixties, on national TV,  
"TRUST, CONSUME, OBEY," subliminally.  
It all begins at birth with a slap on the bum.  
Taught ever to fear them, from here to kingdom come.  

## Verse 3 - Trauma

You think you paid your taxes, they want all you got!  
"Follow the rules or we'll take your mug shot!"  
They know if you're pregnant by watching what you bought.  
Treated just like cattle -- we are on a feed lot.  
  
Traumatizing _you_ ever since you've been a tot:  
"Don't you rock the boat, just sit down into your slot."  
"No creative thinking, we want a robot."  
Biggest threat to them, my friend, is free thought.  

## Verse 4 - The Military Mirage

"Military might a myth," heard in the service.  
Please don't tell the joint chiefs, they're gonna get nervous!  
Eight tanks operational? More like 3. (What?)  
I hear it works a little bit like this, you see:  

When the general comes inspecting, _ you gotta look good:  
Who cares that there's nothin' under the hood?  
Borrow parts, move 'em, and do what you can,  
Gotta justify that funding from Uncle Sam!  
  
## Verse 5 - Police

Think hard now: apart from TV,  
have you seen police acting heroically?  
Can't recall? The truth, mon ami:  
Police aren't here to aid you or me.  

Rather than serving in a noble band,  
They are fingers on _an_ Invisible Hand.  
They would rather be the boot that stomps the face,  
and, on a good day, faulty evidence place.  

## Verse 6 - Law Enforcement

If shit hits the fan, war in counties will be fought.  
Obama armed the cops, yes, your local SWAT.  
Their armories are full, paid and bought,  
By your money: .223, hollowpoints -- jackpot!  

If surrounded or outnumbered, you may be caught.  
But cops aren't good at range; that's not what they're taught.  
Practice mindfully and you'll make the shot.  
Scratch one thrall -- of the tiny dot!  
  
## Verse 7 - Agenda 21

"Reduce your carbon footprint" while they're using megawatts,  
They think that the Earth is theirs to allot.  
Their plan, FYI, _ is not a pretty thought --  
Control and genocide, taking everything we got.  

Sitting by and watching means: in net we'll be caught.  
Time is getting short, future windows will be naught.  
Heed and listen up because this is our shot:  
To throw the shackles off and discard The Tiny Dot.  

## Verse 8 - Military / Spooks

Though I speak of violence, that path is fraught, with  
Heart-break and mis-ery -- put down the garotte!  
So if a bloodless coup is being sought,  
All we have to do is tax boycott.  

By defunding Uncle Sam, taxation is theft,  
The controllers will quickly _be_ bereft.  
Out with the Dollar, and Fedcoin is null.  
Move to private crypto, before the cull!
