## Verse 1

Lusitania torpedoed,   
hundreds drowned.  But  
Germany had warned dearly, the  
ship, a military target, clearly.  

1982, divers found the truth:  
Britain had deceived its own.   
Millions dead. Two years   
from the founding of the Fed.  

## Chorus

False Flag (AG)  
We spill blood and point the blame (A-F arpeggio)  
False Flag (BG)  
Psychopaths have no shame (EGABGA)  
False Flag (AG)  
Can you believe  (BDBE)  
False Flag (GF)  
Millions are deceived (FCAGE)  

## Verse 2

Ambushed from the Michelin plantation,  
Soldiers could not return fire.  
Rubber more valuable than people  
To those up higher.  

Why were we there? Tonkin Bay.  
Allegedly a fearsome attack  
Official confession from LBJ: "Flying   
fish: all were we shooting that day."  

## Verse 3

Two planes, and three towers.   
Impossible, says Richard Gage.  
Two trillion missing, accounting in flames  
7 holds IRS CIA  

The suspect's Passport immediately found. Flight   
93: no debris, just a hole in the ground.  
Freedoms seized, forever war.  
Sounds like 1984.  

## Bridge

Fear kills your mind  
They want us blind  
Stay calm through the fear  
Be right now, right here  

## Verse 4

Faulty testing,  
Patents before the virus.  
In the land of free, working cures suppresed  
Rockefeller docs want you sick and depressed.  

Pfizer -- Largest criminal fine  
"science" more brainwashing than using one's mind.  
Your money, Your freedom, Your body.  
You think they're gonna stop at your soul?
