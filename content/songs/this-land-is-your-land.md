## Verse 1 - Establish

This land is your land, this land is my land.  
Red state or blue state,   
We aren't peasants, but free p-e-o-ple.  
This land was made for you and me.  

## Verse 2 - Agenda 21

UN Agenda for the 21st Century:  
Eco-friendly? Or total tyranny?  
Depopulation, reset ec-on-o-my.  
Their future don't include you or me!  

## Verse 3 - Rosa Koire, Whistleblowers

Oh, Rosa Koire -- what a hero!  
They might have killed her. It's not unusual.  
At least she warned us about what's co-m-ing.  
The truth was made for you and me.  

## Verse 4 - Smart Cities / 5G

Everything tracked, chipped, and surveilled.  
Internet of things, Internet of bodies...  
5G broadcasting, cameras surr-ou-un-ding:  
Smart cities weren't made for you and me!  

## Verse 5 - Vax passports

And at the restaurant, asked for my papers,  
Couldn't go inside: new segregation.  
First the border, next it's the gro-cer-y.  
Vax passports weren't made for you and me.  

## Verse 6 - Supply Chain

Supply chain collapsing, empty shelves I see.  
While ships sit idle, and full of goodies.  
Dollar inflating, oligarchs med-dl-ing:  
Free markets are NOT what I see!  

## Verse 7 - Grand Solar Minimum

Crop yields dwindling, small ice age coming.  
While they stock up, government blames you.  
Record snowfalls, so much for war-ar-ming.  
Gardening was made for you and me.  

## Verse 8 - Soylent Green

That Soylent Green: not just a movie:  
It's DARPA-funded, Washington legal.  
Before we're too late, we'll stop dys-to-pi-a.  
This land was made for you and me!
