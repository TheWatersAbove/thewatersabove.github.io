We do this for the mission. Over time, we may make this a financially profitable endeavor. For the moment, it's a labor of love.

If you would like to support us, there are multiple ways of helping out:

* [Spread the Word](#spread-the-word)
* [Volunteer](#volunteer)
* [Donate](#donate)

# Spread the Word

<div id="spread-the-word" />

A big way to help is to share our content. Post it on your social media. Send it to your friends. Talk to them about controversial subjects.

Just remember that finesse helps. Larken Rose has a training called ["Candles in the Dark"](https://attendcandles.com/), which details how to speak with loved ones who may be living under varying levels of brainwashing. This may be helpful in navigating the many pitfalls in these kinds of conversations.

Most importantly, work on yourself. Work on your community. Life is lived one moment, one family, one community at a time. We are going to win this one by building up from the grassroots, not by sending down propaganda from the top.
